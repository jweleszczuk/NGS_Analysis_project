# NGS_Analysis_project

University project, neccesary to complete the course. It is based on data from NCBI SRA database. 

# 1. SRP003355 project

## 1.1 Aim of the project
For this porpouse, the project with ID SRP003355, was reviewed. 
The aim of mentioned project was a collective linkage analysis to discover functional mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by whole genome sequencing.

## 1.2 Project data
This SRA project consists of 3 repositories:

- SRX025959: Yeast vac22, wild-type segregant pool

- SRX025958: Yeast vac6, mutant segregant pool

- SRX025957: yeast vac6, wild-type segregant pool

## 2. Downloading data

From each SRA project repostory, only first 1 000 000 read were downloaded.

## 3. Quality control

Next step was based on quality control for each downloaded record.

## 4. Reference genom

## 5. Mapping

## 6. SNP detection

## 7. Variant adnotation

## 8. Results visualisation
