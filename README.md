# NGS_Analysis_project
University project, neccesary to complete the course.

This university project is based on data from NCBI SRA database. For this porpouse, the project with ID SRP003355, was reviewed. 

The aim of mentioned project was a collective linkage analysis to discover functional mutations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by whole genome sequencing.

This SRA project consists of 3 repositories:

First one - SRX025959: Yeast vac22, wild-type segregant pool
Second one - SRX025958: Yeast vac6, mutant segregant pool
Third one - SRX025957: yeast vac6, wild-type segregant pool

From each repostory, only first 1 000 000 read were downloaded.

Following step was based on quality control of each dataset.
